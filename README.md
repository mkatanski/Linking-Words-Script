## <a name="Installing"></a> Installing scripts

There are two places you can install scripts in InDesign: The application folder and the user script folder. The easiest way to find these folders is to open the Scripts panel in InDesign (Window > Automation > Scripts in CS3 and CS4; or Window > Utilities > Scripts in CS5 or later), then right-click on either Application or User. We tend to use "User" for scripts that we've downloaded, but it's up to you and the permissions you have on your computer. From the context menu, choose Reveal in Finder (or Reveal in Windows Explorer).

Inside the folder that opens there is a folder called Scripts panel. Put your scripts inside that.
Any script inside the Scripts Panel folder will show up immediately in InDesign. No need to restart the program.
